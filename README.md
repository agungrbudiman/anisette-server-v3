# anisette-v3-server

A supposedly lighter alternative to [omnisette-server](https://github.com/SideStore/omnisette-server)

Like `omnisette-server`, it supports both currently supported SideStore's protocols (anisette-v1 and 
anisette-v3) but it can also be used with AltServer-Linux.

You can run it using docker, or build it with dub (requires both openssl and zlib, see the Dockerfile 
for dependencies).
